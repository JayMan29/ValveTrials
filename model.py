model.py — Data model for the Late-Breaking Valve Trials card system.

A single `Trial` dataclass captures every field in the standardized card
template. Lists default to empty so that ongoing trials (which have no
results yet) can omit them cleanly. Nothing here renders HTML; see
valve_trials.py for the renderer.
